# Learning Go

Learning Go one small app at a time.

## What this Is

This repo curates my answers to the exercises contained within the official Go tutorial, [a tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1).

## How to Test

To run any of the programs (apps), from within the app's folder execute the command

```bash
go run <name-of-file>.go
```

This requires that you have installed and configured Go on your machine, of course.
